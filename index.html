                Vincent Willem van Gogh (Dutch: [ˈvɪnsənt ˈʋɪləm vɑŋ ˈɣɔx] (About this
                soundlisten);[note 1] 30 March 1853 – 29 July 1890) was a Dutch
                post-impressionist painter who posthumously became one of the most
                famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In a decade,
                he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of
                which date from the last two years of his life. They include landscapes,
                still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold
                colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to
                the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, and his
                suicide at 37 came after years of mental illness, depression and poverty.
                <br><br>
                Born into an upper-middle-class family, Van Gogh drew as a child and was
                serious, quiet, and thoughtful. As a young man he worked as an art dealer,
                often travelling, but became depressed after he was transferred to London.
                He turned to religion and spent time as a Protestant missionary in southern
                Belgium. He drifted in ill health and solitude before taking up painting in
                1881, having moved back home with his parents. His younger brother Theo
                supported him financially, and the two kept a long correspondence by letter.
                His early works, mostly still lifes and depictions of peasant labourers,
                contain few signs of the vivid colour that distinguished his later work. In
                1886, he moved to Paris, where he met members of the avant-garde, including
                Émile Bernard and Paul Gauguin, who were reacting against the Impressionist
                sensibility. As his work developed he created a new approach to still lifes
                and local landscapes. His paintings grew brighter in colour as he developed a
                style that became fully realised during his stay in Arles in the south of
                France in 1888. During this period he broadened his subject matter to include
                series of olive trees, wheat fields and sunflowers.
